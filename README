My build of slstatus.

Shows date and time (in german format), battery percentage, ram usage (in percent and MiB), cpu usage (in percent), volume percentage and mute status via alsa and monitor brightness via xbacklight
Requires a nerdfont for the icons, I use CaskaydiaCove, which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.3.3/CascadiaCode.zip
Also requires DWM with the status2d patch for the colors to work
